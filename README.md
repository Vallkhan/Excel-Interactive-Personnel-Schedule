# Excel-Interactive-Personnel-Schedule

The Personnel Schedule is designed to reduce personnel scheduling errors by limiting the access to the ribbon and the visual basic editor.  This is done by removing the ribbon entirely, password protecting the visual basic editor, provides drop downs and navigation options.  The navigation options allow the user access to an interactive color coded schedule, the event table that tracks all events, and the personnel table that tracks specific information about the user.

The Personnel Schedule provides easy to use functions that provides a visual representation of the events table.  The "add event" button brings up an interactive form that allows a user to add an event. The "edit event" button allows the user to edit the event, and the month buttons will change to the desired month and update all the information on the calendar.  Additionally, the functions on the schedule tab can be restricted to designated personnel.

20 minute timer - prevents one person from locking the file for extended periods.
restricted access - can restrict access of certian functions to limited users
